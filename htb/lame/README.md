# user
  - nmap directory for initial scans
  - anonymous ftp, ftp version is old (2.3.4) -> look up cve?
    - [yep, there's even a metasploit module for it](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor/)
    - msfconsole gives us a "exploit completed, but no session was created message"
    - tried doing the exploit manually too (telneting in and using "USER foo:)" and "PASS bar"), but to no avail
    - start looking at other services for now
  - ssh version is also old (4.7p1)
    - don't see any glaring cve's/exploits for this at first glance, moving on
  - ports 139 and 445 -> smb enumeration time
    - check the version first, google 'smbd 3.0.20-Debian cve'
    - found [this](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16320), a metasploit module for the same version of smb
    - looks like it'll give us code execution, so try it out
    - `use exploit/multi/samba/usermap\_script`
    - `set RHOST 10.10.10.3`
    - `run`
    - and you get a root shell lmao
  - user & root pwned
