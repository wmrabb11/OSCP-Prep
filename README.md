## Guides
  - [Starting Point](https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/2019/03/29/The_Journey_to_Try_Harder-_TJNulls_Preparation_Guide_for_PWK_OSCP.html)

## Info Sheets
As a part of prepping, I wanted to have some notes/cheat sheets to keep a record of what I know and update it as I learn more. These can be found in `InfoSheets`

## Practice
Working on the recommended htb boxes from the Guide. Write-ups can be found in the `HTB` directory
